# Intro

I'm passionate about DevOps and web development, bringing both interests together through hands-on projects that deepen my technical expertise. Currently an Advanced Diploma student in Computer Engineering at [Sheridan Collge](https://www.sheridancollege.ca/), I've worked on projects that involve building full-stack applications, deploying on cloud platforms, and implementing CI/CD pipelines. These experiences have fueled my enthusiasm for bridging development and operations to create efficient, scalable solutions.

# Currently

# Some history
- When I was in 3rd grade, I used to go to my friend's house to play Subway Surfer on their tablet.

- In 6th grade, my uncle introduced me to video games like Power Rangers and racing games. That same year, I was also appreciated by my teacher for the first time because of my academic achievement of 92%.

- In 9th grade, I got my first smartphone, a Samsung. Then in 11th grade, I got my second smartphone, an iPhone 6s. During the COVID pandemic, I had trouble attending online classes due to its low battery life, and it also caused issues while playing PUBG. My aunt then bought me a Realme 9 Pro smartphone.
